# yourtodolist
its a simple yet very useful todo app in vanilla javascript 
It has feature such as delete todo individually or all todos in one time. you can open custom modal for every todo which shows information such as time and date. it has amazing ui with sliding remove button on hover on todos. modal closes when clicked outside the modal.
One of the most amazing thing is it is cross browser tabs todo app, means when user adds a todo or remove a todo on another tab the changes will reflect on all tabs.
